# CSC372-Project1-Unity

I could not find a way to properly share the unity file, so I just uploaded the part where I modify. 
i don't know if it works.
but let me know if you cannot. 

1. The background image is image title starts with "Adobe" -> adobe stock images.
2. The background effect is C# script called "BAckgroundEffect.cs",
3. Even though there are some changes, but when I play the game, the camera view wasn't moving. so I need to fix this bug tomorrow (Thursday)
4. Thank you.
