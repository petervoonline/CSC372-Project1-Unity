# CSC372-Project1-Unity
Current Status:
The game object created is just initial setup made by Unity.

Figured out how to commit by using Github Desktop from Unity to Github.
-> You need to create teh local repository first and create the project, or clone the project as you wish.
-> if you don't create the local repository first to your local computer, it's very hard to copy over files or folders to githubs.

There are two branches. 
I might mainly working on Jiwon's branch and pull request everytime there's an big update.
